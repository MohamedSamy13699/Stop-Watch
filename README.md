Stop Watch
The Requirments of the Stop Watch System.
Implement the following Stop Watch system with the specifications listed below:
1-Use ATmega32 Microcontroller with frequency 1Mhz.
2-Configure Timer1 in ATmega32 with CTC mode to count the Stop Watch time.
3-Use six Common Anode 7-segments.
4-Connect the six 7-segments in the project using the multiplexed technique. You should use one 7447 decoder for all 7-segments and control the enable/disable for each 7-segement using a 
5-NPN BJT transistor connect to one of the MCU pins. Like the below image:
